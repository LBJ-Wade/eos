Du, Steiner, and Holt (2018) Phenomenological EOS
=================================================

This C++ code constructs the equation of state of homogeneous nucleonic
matter for use in simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron
star mergers. This code was originally described in a paper on
`arxiv.org <https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09710>`_. The source code is
available on `github <https://github.com/padiac/eos>`_. The
installation of `Boost <http://www.boost.org>`_, `GSL
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl>`_ (versions 1.16 and later), `HDF5
<http://www.hdfgroup.org>`_ (versions 1.8.14 and later), and the most
current version of `O2scl
<https://isospin.roam.utk.edu/static/code/o2scl/index.html>`_ is
required.
